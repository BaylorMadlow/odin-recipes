    <img src = "../images/deviled-eggs.jpeg" alt = "Photo of the deviled eggs.">
    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> This wonderful recipe was borrowed from website <a href = "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/165944/easy-deviled-eggs/" >allrecipes</a> and it's ingredients list is made for 12 servings.</p>
    <p> As simple as it is, preparing this still takes time. You should consider how much of it you have left before the party starts, unless you want to find yourself standing in the kitchen at 9AM having impulsively bought 3 dozens of eggs and wondering what made you think you can finish them in half an hour. Because I do not have a clue.</p>
